# Polio_classification
A machine learning project that attempts to distinguish between samples of circulating type 2 vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV) from immunodeficiency-associated VDPVs (iVDPV). Because cVDPV are contagious but iVDPV are not, the response to a confirmed case of a patient suffering from cVDPV will vary significantly from a case of iVDPV. If we could distinguish these two types of polio virus based on genetic information alone, it would significantly aid the diagnosis and conserve treatment resources that could be used elsewhere.

This is a continuation of the project documented in Zhao, Jorba et al., Computational and Structural Biotechnology
Journal 15 (2017) 456â€“462.
